My career history is quite peculiar. I began working at the age of 14 in Germany as an apprentice. I was born in a poor family and at Mercedes, there was an intern university which rewarded the best apprentices and enabled them to pursue higher education. I worked 15 years for Mercedes where I was received a training in institutional communication: I was a group representative of the group in Africa. When I came back, I went back to school to attend a law faculty, where I completed a first degree, a bachelor, \u00a0then a master degree and then an advanced degree in litigation law. I ended up majoring the \u201cConcours general\u201d a very prestigious competition. Afterwards, I served during 10 years as Ombudsman of the Republic. It was when I left the private sector for a public institution that I discover over-indebtness, because I was not allowed to deal with it. The litigation between a bank and a citizen is a private litigation which is not within the remit of the Ombudsman\u2019s competence. 27 years ago, we started with the creation of a first association based in Strasbourg.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #182d63;\">What was the trigger point that drove you to create this project ?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;right&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#0c71c3&#8243; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; border_width=&#8221;3px&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We created this idea of co-construction and ofstarted thinking of building a partnership with banking institutions for supporting over-indebted households in 2008 at the moment of the subprimes crise. During this crisise of over-indebtness, loans had been allocated without verification. The first who ones who are able to detect fragile clients customers are the bankers (at the view ofthanks to the bank overdraft). We cannot waitcannot afford to wait for indebt people to for the public to come to us., Ppeople generally come to us come very late, ly when their situation is already compromised. If banks handle the mission of to detect them early, instead of doing major heavy surgery, we will be able to support them and help them to go away out from theiris situation.

It is an objective tool (not made by the banks nor oriented toward rich people). We want to use it as a universal tool and I think that if we reach a couple million users, these people will be independent. We also have a project in Luxembourg. I hope that by 2040 the project will have extended to other European countries, particularly in countries such as Poland which need structures like ours.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Interview of Jean-Louis Kiehl, CR\u00c9SUS chairman, reported by Virginie Siaud, November the 9th.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0CR\u00c9SUS\u2019 story: Meeting with Jean-Louis Kiehl, laureate of the France Convergences Award in 2011 About CR\u00c9SUS CR\u00c9SUS is a network of federated not-for-profit associations founded 23 years ago, and whose mission is recognized as being of public utility.
