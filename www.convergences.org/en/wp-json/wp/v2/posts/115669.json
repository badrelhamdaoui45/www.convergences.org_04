Progress is not yet on the scale of the problems facing our generation and does not address their causes: increasing concentration of wealth and its transmission, lack of renewal of elites and social determinism, increasing insecurity, climate change, rapid population growth, conflicts and competition for access to common goods. It is no longer just a question of optimising existing models, but rather of inventing those that will enable our children and our children&#8217;s children to &#8220;make society&#8221; in a more fraternal, equitable and sustainable 21st century.\u00a0 How can we put the economy at the service of the common good?

European perspectives on the debate on the PACTE Law<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The concept of company is not yet &#8220;defined in law&#8221;. The PACTE law \u2013 law that is currently being passed at the French Parliament to transform companies &#8211; and its article 61, allowing the creation of \u201ccompanies with a mission\u201d, would make it possible to change the world&#8217;s view of the company, which would no longer only be &#8220;reducible to an organization aiming at a profit&#8221;. A step forward that would also protect companies from changes in their shareholder framework. Indeed, companies have their share of responsibility in controlling social and environmental impacts, but above all by their ability to provide solutions. Many initiatives have been taken, particularly by energy or polluting industries. Of course, often under the constraint of States and all other stakeholders. But also, and increasingly, at the initiative of the companies themselves, who understand that their ability to develop and therefore create wealth depends on their taking responsibility for the challenges, on the societal role they can play. Some people in France do not hesitate to talk about companies with a mission, regretting that the wording has not been retained &#8211; for the time being &#8211; in the text of the law that will be debated in a few days in the National Assembly. Others consider that a totally liberal approach is needed and therefore that fewer corporate laws are needed and that regulation will be done by the market. It would be denying that the law can encourage, that not everyone is trustworthy and also that free competition can only be exercised if everyone plays by the same rules. It would also mean trying to make people believe that everyone has the same abilities, and forgetting a little quickly that some activities, because they are social and solidarity, need specific rules and strong public support.<\/p>\n<p>Thus the company is a powerful force for innovation and transformation. Legally, it only follows a private interest with a view to profit. It is a question of inviting the company to define its mission and purpose, mainspring, finality and to commit itself to it. This is how we will regain confidence in the company.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;Blanche Segrestin&#8221; company_name=&#8221;Mines ParisTech&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; portrait_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/\u00a9R\u00e9my-Deluze-369.jpg&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>The company is now able to transform the world.

While new signatures are expected in September, the Convergences World Forum provided an opportunity to review this mechanism dedicated to finance social innovation.<\/p>\n<p>Two years after its launch in France by Martine Pinville, then Secretary of State for the Social and Solidarity Economy (see our article of 17 March 2016), what has the social impact contract become ? On the 4<sup>th<\/sup> of September, during the Convergences World Forum, a conference was held to review this new financing tool for social innovation, which is based on a partnership between five actors. A &#8220;project leader&#8221;, often from the SSE, &#8220;one or more investors who will finance this experiment and who will be reimbursed according to the results&#8221;, a &#8220;payer at the end&#8221; &#8211; the State, a local authority, a foundation&#8230; -, an &#8220;independent evaluator&#8221; and a &#8220;structurer&#8221;. The objective is therefore to attract private investors to social projects.<\/p>\n<p>At this stage, only one social impact contract (CIS) &#8220;has been signed and started&#8221;; led by Adie, the project aims to develop micro-credit in rural areas.

The challenge is to know how to take advantage of the dynamics of the Olympic Games to push projects in a sustainable way and boost innovation, particularly in Seine Saint Denis where 80% of the facilities will be built and how to associate the local economic fabric in a co-contracting approach, so that job creation benefits the least privileged territories and people.<\/p>\n<p>If SSE in the Maghreb region is only in its infancy (0.6% of jobs vs. 10% in France) and is poorly structured, it has the merit of structuring entire sectors of the informal economy (crafts, agriculture) in which women are mainly involved. To encourage its development, the actors present at the Forum underlined the need to work on the recognition of the sector by legislating, training, promoting SSE access to the market, financing and allowing the sharing of experience.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_accordion admin_label=&#8221;Accord\u00e9on&#8221;
