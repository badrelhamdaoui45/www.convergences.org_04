It is a matter of contributing to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at our respective scales and collectively, reflecting and acting together to respond to the seemingly contradictory demand for a world without poverty, and that for a carbon-free world.<\/p>\n<p>Demographic growth, exponential urbanisation, global warming, wars and conflicts, terrorism, increasing global inequalities \u2026 It is in this context and in the face of these challenges that multi-actor partnerships have grown in size and numbers in the last years. Unsurprisingly, the simple sectoral solutions proposed to address these challenges have clearly failed. Indeed, silo action has for corollary a duplication of efforts, a loss of efficiency and productivity, and even power struggles in some cases.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlone, we go fast, together we go far\u201d. Partnerships between a variety of actors to promote sustainable finance, technological advances, and capacity building \u2013 all of which are SDGs\u00a0\u00a0Targets \u2013 is a requirement for success. When it comes to the issues facing our generations and our planet, the truth is that none of us can address them alone.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_button admin_label=&#8221;Bouton&#8221; button_url=&#8221;http:\/\/impakter.com\/sdg-17-unity-strength\/?utm_content=bufferac9a4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; button_text=&#8221;Read more on Impakter&#8221; button_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; custom_button=&#8221;on&#8221; button_text_color=&#8221;#313f55&#8243; button_border_color=&#8221;#313f55&#8243; button_letter_spacing=&#8221;0&#8243; button_use_icon=&#8221;default&#8221; button_icon_placement=&#8221;right&#8221; button_on_hover=&#8221;on&#8221; button_letter_spacing_hover=&#8221;0&#8243;] [\/et_pb_button][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Read our op-ed in the sustainable development media Impakter Collaboration and multi-stakeholder partnerships have now become overused terms, new fashionable expressions adopted by companies, public institutions and the non-profit ecosystem.
