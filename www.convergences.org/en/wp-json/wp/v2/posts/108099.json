Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Roussel, Founder and Development Director of NGO ACTED, defended the vision of a \u201cZero exclusion, Zero carbon, Zero poverty\u201d world that calls all individuals and organizations to think and act together as to respond to the duty of achieving a world without exclusion, carbon and poverty.<\/p>\n<p>The 3Zero Global Alliance empowers stakeholders from all over the world to make lasting connections to create positive change and, together, educate and advocate to shape solutions and multisector partnerships that save and improve millions of lives. It inspires stakeholders to drive societal change and address some of the most pressing issues the world faces today.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are the last generation that can truly have a positive impact on the issues of exclusion, climate change and poverty,\u201d asserted Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Roussel. \u201cThis is both a heavy responsibility to bear and a challenge to meet. A challenge that can only be faced if each and every citizen has a voice and is in a position, individually or collectively, to influence his\/her own development. If we want to, we have the capacity to drastically tackle these issues and the Sustainable Developments Goals have clearly paved the way for such an ambition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>In Yangon, ACTED called upon civil society, public and private actors but also academics and the media to work together on addressing the poverty challenge that most of the world\u2019s population still faces, through an inclusive and low carbon growth, limited in use of natural resources and rich in personal and collective development. In order to do so in an inclusive, cross-sectoral and creative manner, stakeholders were called to join the 3Zero Global Alliance for a \u201cZero exclusion, Zero carbon, Zero poverty\u201d world <\/strong><strong>(<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.3zero.org\"><strong>www.3zero.org<\/strong><\/a><strong>)<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cTogether, as 3Zero Global Alliance, we hold governments, companies, NGOs, citizens and all other actors\u00a0to account to their duties and responsibilities for the Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved and thus the future of humanity and our planet safeguarded.\u201c concluded Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Roussel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>YOUR CONTACTS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For any further information, please visit the 3Zero Global Alliance 3Zero website www.3zero.org, or contact Emilie Poisson in Myanmar, <a href=\"mailto:emilie.poisson@convergences.org\">emilie.poisson@convergences.org<\/a> and Adrien Tomarchio in Paris <a href=\"mailto:adrien.tomarchio@acted.org\">adrien.tomarchio@acted.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Press release \u201cTogether, lets build a Zero exclusion, Zero carbon &amp; Zero poverty world!\u201d NGO ACTED launches the Global Alliance for a Zero exclusion, Zero carbon &amp; Zero poverty world in Yangon, Myanmar on 10th March 2017 &nbsp; Yangon, 10 March 2017 \u2013 The conclusion of the Convergences Myanmar Forum \u201cStrengthening cooperation towards sustainable development [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":108103,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[126],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/108099"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=108099"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/108099\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":108105,"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/108099\/revisions\/108105"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/108103"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=108099"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=108099"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=108099"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
