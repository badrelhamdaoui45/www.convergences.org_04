By 2050, an additional 2.5 billion people are expected to live in cities. In concrete terms, it means that 2 out of 3 people in the world will be living in urban areas within 30 years, if this UN forecast is accurate. This perspective leads to deep reflection on the structuring of such urban spaces in order for them to remain sustainable. Today, it must be recognized that our cities need to begin their transition to more inclusive, sustainable and resilient models. Indeed, 70% of the world&#8217;s GDP is concentrated in urban areas, but 70% of the total waste happens there as well, which gives rise to an alarming figure: 60% of greenhouse effect gases are concentrated on 2% of the planet&#8217;s surface.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_63 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Contenus de la page<\/p>\n<label for=\"ez-toc-cssicon-toggle-item-65e5980ccb731\" class=\"ez-toc-cssicon-toggle-label\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"eztoc-hide\" style=\"display:none;\">Toggle<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-icon-toggle-span\"><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" class=\"list-377408\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M6 6H4v2h2V6zm14 0H8v2h12V6zM4 11h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2zM4 16h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2z\" fill=\"currentColor\"><\/path><\/svg><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" class=\"arrow-unsorted-368013\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"10px\" height=\"10px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.2\" baseProfile=\"tiny\"><path d=\"M18.2 9.3l-6.2-6.3-6.2 6.3c-.2.2-.3.4-.3.7s.1.5.3.7c.2.2.4.3.7.3h11c.3 0 .5-.1.7-.3.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7zM5.8 14.7l6.2 6.3 6.2-6.3c.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7c-.2-.2-.4-.3-.7-.3h-11c-.3 0-.5.1-.7.3-.2.2-.3.5-.3.7s.1.5.3.7z\"\/><\/svg><\/span><\/span><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\"  id=\"ez-toc-cssicon-toggle-item-65e5980ccb731\"  aria-label=\"Toggle\" \/><nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-5'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/relive-the-11th-world-convergences-forum-sdg-11-tomorrows-cities\/#Overview_and_challenges_for_cities_in_transition\" title=\"Overview and challenges for cities in transition: \">Overview and challenges for cities in transition: <\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-5'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/relive-the-11th-world-convergences-forum-sdg-11-tomorrows-cities\/#Which_stakeholders_of_the_transition\" title=\"Which stakeholders of the transition?\">Which stakeholders of the transition?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-5'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/relive-the-11th-world-convergences-forum-sdg-11-tomorrows-cities\/#A_growing_awareness_of_companies_with_negative_externalities_in_their_territory\" title=\"A growing awareness of companies with negative externalities in their territory\">A growing awareness of companies with negative externalities in their territory<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-5'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/relive-the-11th-world-convergences-forum-sdg-11-tomorrows-cities\/#Role_and_impact_of_public_authorities\" title=\"Role and impact of public authorities \">Role and impact of public authorities <\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-5'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/en\/relive-the-11th-world-convergences-forum-sdg-11-tomorrows-cities\/#Recycling_a_central_sector_of_the_sustainable_transition_of_cities_and_inclusive_of_all_stakeholders_Focus_on_the_challenges_of_plastics_and_Waste_Electrical_and_Electronic_Equipment_WEEE\" title=\"Recycling, a central sector of the sustainable transition of cities and inclusive of all stakeholders.

One example is Paris, within 10 years the city has seen its number of homeless people increase by 84%, not to mention migration-related inflows. This explosion of precariousness on the streets is partly due to the high densification of urban areas, and that is why the promotion of the \u201cLiving Together\u201d movement through local initiatives, which is a major factor in the creation of social cohesion, makes more and more sense.<\/p>\n<p>From a climatic point of view, forecasts for 2050 predict temperatures reaching 50 degrees in the shade during heat wave in Paris. Moreover, it should be noted that at present time, air pollution kills as many people as alcohol and, as Sebastien Maire, Senior Manager of Resilience at the City of Paris, points out: &#8220;you can choose not to drink, more difficult to choose not to breathe&#8221;. A logic of integration of the city into its territory is becoming more and more urgent in the light of the existing pressure in rural areas. For instance, even if we encourage the development of less emissive materials such as wood, this will automatically have an impact on forests, the overall challenge here is to focus on the entire life cycle of each of our actions.<\/p>\n<p>This state of play leads to the following conclusion: \u00a0Paris cannot be considered as a city integrated into a territorial policy, as evidenced by its population density of 21,000\/Km\u00b2, the highest in Europe, the 4th highest in the world and approximately the equivalent of Mumbai in India. To evolve, metropolitan areas like Paris will have to make use of technological innovations while betting on the fact that 60% of the infrastructure at the end of the century is not yet built today.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;G\u00e9rald Maradan&#8221; company_name=&#8221;Co-Founder &amp; CEO, EcoAct &#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; portrait_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Gerald-Maradan-ecoact.jpg&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cities will have to transform, the horizon is getting closer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Which_stakeholders_of_the_transition\"><\/span><strong>Which stakeholders of the transition?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p><u>Initiatives involving the consumer:<\/u><\/p>\n<p>This observation suggests rethinking the actual consideration of urban spaces towards a more local territorial vision where the priority would be now to find actors involved in this transition, but above all to understand their complementarities.

The objective is really to trigger the acceleration of this transition by mobilizing actors able to promote innovation. To take concrete action, public authorities have several levers for action, such as supporting the development of markets with green and sustainable bonds, investing in SMEs focused on sustainable cities (air quality, circular economy, sustainable buildings). In most cases, it is necessary to mobilize both public and private capital in order to obtain synergies of skills and thus have the greatest possible impact.

The example of Central America is all the more alarming because it is a geographical area very vulnerable to climatic events and has a very high population density (84 inhabitants\/km\u00b2 and 50 million inhabitants). Today, 7.5 million people live in precarious housing in Central America. In such a context, it would be natural for the public authorities to seize a phenomenon of this magnitude, however Central America is one of the most unequal regions in the redistribution of land. Indeed, a large part of the population is in conflict with the State and the paramilitaries, due in large part to a redistribution of institutional resources biased by corruption. To take the example of Salvador, 80% of the population does not have access to decent housing due to a lack of resources, while the State invests less than 1% of its budget in social housing.<\/p>\n<p>To respond to this disengagement on the part of public authorities, organizations are replacing it and responding to an urgent need: to make housing a right and a necessity in these regions. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.habitat-cite.org\/\">Habitat-Cit\u00e9<\/a> works internationally for solidarity and support actions towards vulnerable populations. Its objective is to strengthen local skills to improve living spaces (train craftsmen, and women, exchange and disseminate good practices) and consequently the inclusion of populations. Their model is based on an analysis of what people have historically done in response to environmental constraints and then promotes learning. This approach is intended to support change rather than provide it.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item] [\/et_pb_accordion][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>The issue of financing can also be addressed unilaterally by the private sector, as the example of solidarity banks shows. Initiatives of this type help accelerating the transition to sustainable models by financing innovation. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lanef.com\/\">La Nef<\/a>, which is present at the Forum Convergences, is a specialized credit institution in the form of a cooperative. Its status allows it to offer savings and credit solutions oriented towards projects with a social, ecological and\/or cultural utility. It is through the creation of financial tools for citizen participation that it sets in motion and supports new ways of producing, consuming, undertaking and living.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Recycling_a_central_sector_of_the_sustainable_transition_of_cities_and_inclusive_of_all_stakeholders_Focus_on_the_challenges_of_plastics_and_Waste_Electrical_and_Electronic_Equipment_WEEE\"><\/span><strong>Recycling, a central sector of the sustainable transition of cities and inclusive of all stakeholders.

Indeed, this activity requires particular attention and follow-up from all existing stakeholders if it want to be operational on a large scale. It is the result of a long process and includes a multitude of actors, from the company to the citizen and including local authorities. To promote such initiatives, companies as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citeo.com\/\">CITEO<\/a> are created with the objective of developing an ecosystem around the circular economy and thus meeting the two main current recycling constraints: technology and economics. Driven by the companies themselves, this structure aims to respond to the entire recycling chain by providing support ranging from eco-design to communication and compliance.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;Jean Hornain&#8221; company_name=&#8221;CITEO&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>It is to the industrial producing companies to finance the end-of-life management of their products<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Focus_on_plastic\"><\/span><strong>Focus on plastic:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>Worldwide, plastic production is exponential. In 20 years, more plastic has been produced than in 50 years before 1998. Plastic production generates 400,000 tons of CO2 worldwide each year, the equivalent of the emissions of a country like France. The Coca-Cola Company has launched a large-scale campaign with the objective of recovering 100% of the plastic packaging produced by the brand by 2030. Nevertheless, as Arnaud Rolland, CSR Director at Coca-Cola European Partners France, reminds us, today the demand for recycled plastic is greater than the supply. This is a paradox in France, given that every second bottle is recycled.<\/p>\n<p>However, a ton of plastic costs 1000 euros and companies know it. In addition, the more complicated the packaging, the more packaging there is, and the higher the costs will be for the company: both for production and recycling. This observation calls for greater efforts to be made in terms of technological innovation, which is still too limited today, particularly in terms of recycling and alternative materials. It is necessary to create materials that do not generate waste or non-disposable waste with a new logistics circuit.<\/p>\n<p>The process is therefore underway in some large companies and the main blocking points are the lack of homogenization of an ecosystem where all stakeholders should be included in the process. Under these conditions, as Arnaud Schwartz of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fne.asso.fr\/\">France Nature Environnement<\/a> and member of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eesc.europa.eu\/fr\">European Economic and Social Committee<\/a> points out, it is crucial to sensitive citizens through partnerships with public and private organizations about this transgenerational issue.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>The development of this sector therefore lies in the synchronization of these actors in order to be as efficient as possible. All strata are concerned by the need to simplify sorting for households by modernizing sorting centers so that, by 2025, no packaging remains without a solution (plastic\/aluminum mixture). It is also a question of organizing a collection &#8220;in a colossal way&#8221; by raising awareness among citizens. The production actors must also review their model by integrating more technological innovations, thus reducing their environmental impact.<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"i\"><\/span><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Focus_on_Waste_Electrical_and_Electronic_Equipment_WEEE\"><\/span><strong><u>Focus on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE):<\/u><\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>In a completely different approach, the management of WEEE, especially in developing countries, poses very different challenges: rapid growth and significant management constraints in view of some of the toxic components that constitute them. The fact that recycling is not yet part of local culture, in Africa for example, and that people keep their old equipment is an additional challenge in the treatment of WEEE.<\/p>\n<p>The WEEECAM project, which received the IPPAG International Convergence Award, initiated by <a href=\"http:\/\/solidarite-technologique.org\/\">Solidarit\u00e9 Technologique<\/a>, for the moment located in Cameroon but which could be exported to the rest of Africa, aims to collect and process these WEEE. This project aims to demonstrate the economic viability of recycling through institutional and financial partnerships while including civil society in the process. The question here is who should be included in such a mechanism and how. Theoretically, European countries are also responsible for the management of electronic waste because they are the producing countries. African governments are more concerned with security and defense but should set up a legal framework on WEEE, and local institutions must be made responsible for the implementation of legal texts in this area. NGOs, such as Solidarit\u00e9 Technologique, have the role of contributing to raising everyone&#8217;s awareness in order to create a homogeneous whole that acts as an ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Valuation_of_innovations_and_good_practices\"><\/span><strong>Valuation of innovations and good practices:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>Innovation is at the center of the evolution of good practices. However, in order for their impact to be real, it is crucial to give them visibility, which is not always the case. It is under these conditions that the CGET and La Fonda have promoted the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.carrefourdesinnovationssociales.fr\/\">carrefour des innovations sociales<\/a>\u201d (crossroads of social innovations), a project that aimed at identifying all the social innovations in France. This tool will make it possible to visualize good practices as a whole, a major challenge, particularly in the context of the transition of cities. Indeed, having a national and precise vision of territorial innovations makes it possible to promote the networking of project leaders and support staff and thus boost the sector.<\/p>\n<p>The revitalization of territories involves also in many cases the creation of complementary and citizen local currencies. Indeed, this trend reflects a general desire on the part of citizens to be inked in their territory and is a credible alternative for consumption. A practice that requires a global change in consumption habits but allows the development of local innovations. With a desire to develop short circuits and circular economy through partnerships and synergies, MLCCs respond to the challenge of accessibility and visibility among the initiators of good practices. These awareness-raising tools against overconsumption help guide citizens towards services that are committed to the sustainable transition of their territory. Today, there is the problem of financing and developing a sustainable business model that would bring these new currencies into a broader dimension. To do this, more than 30 local currencies have gathered to create the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sol-reseau.org\/\">Mouvement Sol<\/a>\u201d in order to raise their voice up to public authorities. Among them, the Convergence World Forum had the opportunity to host La Gonette: local currency of the Lyon area, <a href=\"https:\/\/unemonnaiepourparis.org\/\">Une monnaie pour Paris<\/a> (A currency for Paris): La P\u00eache and <a href=\"https:\/\/mytroc.fr\/comment-ca-marche\">Mytroc<\/a> with its nuts. In this sense, these structures are increasing calls to public authorities through media forums such as the one in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lemonde.fr\/idees\/article\/2018\/04\/30\/les-collectivites-locales-doivent-pouvoir-payer-en-monnaie-complementaire_5292457_3232.html?xtmc=monnaies_locales&amp;xtcr=4\">Le Monde published last March.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In order to make these initiatives more accessible to the citizen, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.poi.app\/\">POI<\/a> Company aims to digitize part of the process by using the &#8220;block chain&#8221; as a basis. This application will reward responsible consumption by offering local currency. This initiative will connect currencies and facilitate their acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_accordion admin_label=&#8221;Accord\u00e9on&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221;
