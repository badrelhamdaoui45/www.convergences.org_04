It was a period when I had achieved my \u2018main\u2019 life goals: I had a job I loved, unlimited opportunities to continue learning, to continue to grow in my career and I had a comfortable life in the beautiful city of San Francisco in California. But, my personal happiness \u2018index\u2019 started declining, for no apparent reason. I loved and still love to design, to create. When the second gulf war started, it was the \u2018kick in the butt\u2019. I could be part of the problem (continue living for myself), or be part of the solution (contribute positively to this planet). Designing an efficient cooking stove for people at the base of the pyramid (BoP) was the convergence of my state of mind, what I loved doing and what I felt I needed to do.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row admin_label=&#8221;Ligne&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243;][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Did your participation to the Convergences Award generate the creation of new partnerships?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For Prakti, a social enterprise based in faraway India, attending the Convergences Award allowed us to connect, meet in person\u00a0with great social impact organisations in Paris, (which is necessary for improving our partnerships). We started a fruitfuil collaboration with MakeSense: we met and connected with 2 great professionals who later joined our team in India. We also connected with high quality interns from Ecole Centrale de Paris who worked also at our lab in India. MakeSense ran a successful crowdfunding campaign for Prakti, raising 15,000\u20ac.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row admin_label=&#8221;Ligne&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243;][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Since your nomination to the Convergences Award, did the nature of your partnerships evolve?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We won the International Convergences Award for the partnership between Prakti, who was in charge of the product\u2019s design, the engineering part and the distribution, and SkillMech who was doing the manufacturing part. This partnership was excellent for both parties. It generated business for manufacturers and it allowed Prakti to bring a high quality product to the market in a very short period of time, without the expertise or need to invest in manufacturing. But as business matured, it became clear that we needed to do a major shift in production strategy. Instead of working with an exclusive manufacturer, we had to be in direct control of all production steps and cost, and we had shift production from one single, do it all factory, to multiple component suppliers. Prakti exclusive partnership with SkillMech was not fitting anymore with the needs of the market and we finished the partnership in 2016.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, partnerships, including commercial ventures, often need to evolve or finish. Particularly in the social enterprise sector which evolves and pivots a lot, more than the commercial sector with is more mature, more established. For this reason, partnerships die, change of nature or are created more often in social sector.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Did visibility and recognition gained with your project motivated new aspirations of engagement for you and your team?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>Winning the International Convergences Award did give us credibility.

Except that in our experience, as entrepreneur in the hardware, we found very few people (impact funders, foundations, impact investor) who had an experience in this field. Most of their expertise was in software (mobile), distribution, financing (microfinance institutions), sometimes packaging (solar). The sector above are very different from hardware sector, they take much less time, much less investment to go from idea, to startup, to first established sales.
