Knowing the needs (data and medical follow-up of patients), having the physical means to access populations and provide them with the necessary medical assistance (cold chain), overcoming cultural barriers and acceptance of treatments, these are some of the points that hinder access to health for all.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Faivre-Tavignot&#8221; company_name=&#8221;Action tank Entreprises &amp; Pauvret\u00e9, HEC&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; portrait_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte-Faivre-Tavignot-HEC.jpg&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The bottlenecks in terms of access to health for all, can be summarized as follows: &#8220;4 A&#8217;s&#8221;:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Affordability\u00a0: How population will be able to pay for it <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility\u00a0: How do we do to reach the last kilometer <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Awareness \u00a0: how people are aware of the need <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Acceptability\u00a0: how acceptable it is<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The case of Philippine and his 7000 islands is an example of the health issues in developing countries. The country has doubled his population in about 20 years and with only one doctor for every 30,000 people and a lack of digitalisation, the infrastructure is not adequate. Rural populations are particularly concerned by the issue of accessibility.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Africa there are less than 3 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants and only, on average, one health center 8 km away, 80% of the population has a mobile phone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So how can we capitalize on this technology to improve access to health for all? Digital technology can reduce this distance at a lower cost, but e-health raises the question of data security. A pilot remote diagnostic project in Botswana has been abandoned because innovation there has been no ethical safeguards to secure access to data. It is therefore essential to support developing countries so that they can make informed decisions on the protection of their health and other data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The way of life and the way population evolve have also become major health issues for the future. Nutrition must be an integral part of the health approach. Health is thus a challenge at the crossroads of human, industrial and environmental dimensions, and the scope of its challenges extends to all these dimensions. It is therefore a question of informing consumers as well as possible about what they are buying, in order to empower them, for example by displaying the carbon impact of a product. This display would also make it possible, at the end of the chain, to make manufacturers more responsible. Ideally, negative environmental and social externalities would be integrated into the product price, to encourage the consumption of healthy and responsible products. In France, we can also count on the role of local authorities in social ecology by providing land for food aid, for example.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;Rose Boursier-Wyler&#8221; company_name=&#8221;Too Good To Go&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; portrait_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Rose-Boursier-Wyler-too-good-to-go.jpg&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>The food has an environmental cost, social cost and a cost on our health.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;Pierre Fr\u00e9zal&#8221; company_name=&#8221;Sanofi&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; portrait_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Pierre-fr\u00e9zal-sanofi.jpg&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Be careful to not neglect the new types of pandemics for which we must prepare, such as diabetes, since in some countries Coca is cheaper than water, while 2.1 billion people do not have access to drinking water, or three in ten people in the world.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_innovate_for_the_health_of_tomorrow\"><\/span><strong>How to innovate for the health of tomorrow?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs (MEAE), through its Secretary of State, presented the French innovation strategy for access to health for all.

And for this purpose it is necessary to consolidate innovative financing such as the MUSKOKA Fund (see next section).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beyond funding, it is necessary to succeed to demonstrate pedagogy and use education through entertainment and cross-media strategies, in a context where the use of new information and communication technologies (NICTs) is expanding, to change behaviour, particularly on subjects that are at the heart of the French strategy such as health, gender equality or the elimination of gender-based violence.

Interdisciplinary meetings must be encouraged to create frameworks conducive to the emergence of new ideas and to facilitate collaboration between the various actors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;Fabien Courteille &#8221; company_name=&#8221;Gawad Kalinga&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; portrait_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Gabien-Courteille-Gawad-Kalinga.jpg&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Most of health issues do not come from the health.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Then_what_are_the_key_steps_to_ensure_the_success_of_these_health_innovations\"><\/span><strong>Then, what are the key steps to ensure the success of these health innovations?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Through the computer graphics presented at the Forum, the Convergences Working Group on Health and Innovations tentatively gathered the main steps through which a health innovation must go through to be and remain effective. These steps can be carried out simultaneously and function in a circular way, i.e. they are enriched by each other. Innovating in health is therefore a more organic than mechanical process. It should be noted that accessibility is a transversal theme at these different stages. It is based on 3 axes: price (affordability), use (for beneficiaries), and use (by practitioners). These steps will be enriched by concrete examples (see p. 2) provided by the members of the Convergences Working Group.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image admin_label=&#8221;Image&#8221; src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Livrable-Acces-a-la-sante-part2.jpg&#8221; show_in_lightbox=&#8221;off&#8221; url=&#8221;http:\/\/bit.ly\/2qa1StA&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; use_overlay=&#8221;off&#8221; animation=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky=&#8221;off&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; force_fullwidth=&#8221;off&#8221; always_center_on_mobile=&#8221;on&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;] [\/et_pb_image][et_pb_accordion admin_label=&#8221;Accord\u00e9on&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;] [et_pb_accordion_item]<\/p>\n<p><em>Convergence thanks the structures that helped it to prepare this document : Amundi Asset Management, AP-HP, Croix Rouge Fran\u00e7aise, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA, echOpen, FAMOCO, Fondation Pierre Fabre, Fondation Sanofi Espoir, La Paillasse, Nantucket Capital, Sanofi, Solthis.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item] [\/et_pb_accordion][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;Nithya Ramanatha&#8221; company_name=&#8221;Nexleaf&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; portrait_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Nithya-Ramanatha-Nexleaf.jpg&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>When there is data that you trust, everybody is very motivated and knows they are working in the same direction.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_funding_for_the_tomorrow_finance\"><\/span><strong>What funding for the tomorrow finance? <\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many people in both developing and developed countries give up care or postpone it due to the lack of adequate and accessible care structures or the lack of financial resources to access it. States, local authorities, NGOs, or investment funds, there are many actors in health financing. While health funding increased between 2000 and 2010, it has since decreased. Indeed, financing is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. Donors require very specific monitoring and data, which causes a lot of pressure. In addition, corporate foundations no longer finance projects but wish to implement them themselves. The main donors in the health sector are the United States (mainly for AIDS), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (mainly for infectious disease) and France through the French Delopment Agency (AFD).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><u>Therefore, how can the different investment mechanisms be articulated to finance an area such as health, which often promises only a low return on investment from a financial point of view? <\/u><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, stakeholders agree that partnerships should be fostered, through the sharing of quality information and the creation of a circle of experts to judge it. Connections must be made to find out where the others stand and avoid unnecessary duplication. The public-private partnership model has made it possible to capitalize on the sum of the comparative advantages of their partners and the business model to accelerate access to vaccines and ensure sustainable financing. Other partnerships in kind can be set up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secondly, in terms of financing mechanisms, microfinance, often presented as a miracle development tool, is not well suited to financing access to health, because of its cost and its own functions. In this field, it is necessary to prefer impact investing (or hybrid finance, thematic investment funds, inclusive insurance). Another way to finance the health of tomorrow is to help large companies think about their social impacts, by developing social impact contracts. Other solutions make it possible to make a model sustainable according to the social enterprise model.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beyond funding mechanisms, models of health profitability must be explored. Indeed, it appears that investments in the health sector often have an economic (and not financial) return that can be observed in the short term. Thus, the training of midwives in a developing country reduces infant mortality and complications for women who give birth, thus having an impact on the development of the whole society.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But if the health supply has a viable economic model, it is often more complicated to raise the necessary funds to repay the initial investment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is then necessary to set up a health system that is both very cheap &#8211; and therefore very accessible &#8211; while being sufficiently profitable to be able to attract investors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These issues of profitability and solvency of health projects, as intrinsic conditions for their financing by third parties, necessarily lead us to think and invest in innovative business models that are capable of being &#8220;profitable&#8221; both to be self-financing and to repay initial investors. It is also necessary to support the emergence of indicators and measurement tools adapted to health projects, to take into account their global impact on other areas of development.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image admin_label=&#8221;Image&#8221; src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Livrable-Finance-et-Sant\u00e9-part2.jpg&#8221; show_in_lightbox=&#8221;off&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; use_overlay=&#8221;off&#8221; animation=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky=&#8221;off&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; force_fullwidth=&#8221;off&#8221; always_center_on_mobile=&#8221;on&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;] [\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>The tool developed by the Convergence Working Group &#8211; Health Financing &#8211; and presented at the Forum aims to describe the financial and extra-financial circuits that health projects follow, from their financing to returns on investment and including certain virtuous economic models.

Health and climate change interventions around the world are hampered by a lack of data. The data allow the following questions to be answered: Does the equipment we are deploying work properly? Does it have the impact it is supposed to have? Are the initiatives undertaken by the global development community really working? Nexleaf has shown how access to meaningful real-time data enables reactive interventions, including monitoring and evaluation, self-correction and accountability mechanisms that have a verifiable impact. For them, robust, resilient and cost-effective technology can bridge the gap where other infrastructure is lacking. In the case of vaccines, if the fridges fail, the vaccines are unusable so developing the Internet of Things (IoT) for the cold chain seemed obvious to Nexleaf in order to have real-time alerts on the condition of the fridges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sanofi Espoir Foundation<\/strong>, in an attempt to provide operational responses, has decided to explore areas where needs remain major and unmet: improving pre- and post-natal care and preventing and controlling maternal and neonatal infections.
