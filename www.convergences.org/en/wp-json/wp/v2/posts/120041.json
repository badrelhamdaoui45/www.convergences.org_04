Afterworks shines the light on committed and passionate young people who share their experiences and their vision of a more inclusive and sustainable society. The goal of these afterworks is to motivate people who don\u2019t dare to commit themselves to a good cause and to support them to do so!<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>For its September monthl afterwork, the Youth We Can\u00a0! collective met to discuss the intergenerational bond at <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.larecyclerie.com\/\"><strong>La REcyclerie<\/strong><\/a><strong>, <\/strong><strong>a sustainable place in the \u201cPetite Ceinture\u201d of Paris<\/strong>. Accompanying an elder to its medical appointment, helping them displace furniture, sharing an apartment with them or just buy them a drink\u2026 there are lots of different things for young people to do with elders in order to build a strong bond of solidarity and friendship. At the last Youth We Can! afterwork on October 9, 2019, 5 persons, including 4 young people and an elder lady came to share their experiences about building and maintaining an intergenerational link.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Doing a favor, go walking, sharing a drink or blowing candles\u2026 how to connect young people to elders?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Numerous organizations put young people in relation with elders for them to share nice moments together. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parisencompagnie.org\/\">Paris en Compagnie<\/a> is one of them. Supported by the City of Paris, the project was built by tree organizations: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.petitsfreresdespauvres.fr\/\">Petits Fr\u00e8res des Pauvres<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luludansmarue.org\/\">Lulu dans ma rue<\/a> et <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autonomie-paris-saint-jacques.fr\/\">Autonomie Paris Saint-Jacques<\/a>. <strong>Its goal is to stop the isolation of elders by putting them in relation with committed citizens thanks to a mobile application, so that elders can be accompanied in their daily tasks or amusements<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After finishing business school, Nesma wanted to have a job that makes sense and has a positive impact on society. Today, she is a communication officer at Paris en Compagnie. She works with more than <strong>700 engaged citizens who accompany the 600 elders registered on the app and break their isolation<\/strong>. Among them, Paule, aged 87, a \u201cregular\u201d of Paris en Compagnie\u2019s program, as she says. She quickly appreciated being surrounded by young people. They bring her comfort and allow her to got out and not \u201cwatch television alone all day long\u201d. Having a drink or going for a walk accompanied by young people makes her daily life more enjoyable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Improving elder\u2019s daily life is also the goal of Alexandre. By helping his grand-mother do small things such as plugging a printer or putting a song in a playlist, he realized how elders needed help to go through \u201csmall daily challenges\u201d, as he call them, and especially those linked to digital. After he engaged himself in the fight against food waste by co-founding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lilo.org\/fr\/graapz\/\">Graapz<\/a>, Alexandre decided to pursue his career as a social-entrepreneur by committing himself to help elders age well. Therefore, he founded <a href=\"http:\/\/allolouis.com\/\">Allo Louis<\/a>, an intergenerational service providing help to elders by putting them in relation with students of their neighborhood. From changing a lightbulb to moving furniture, elders have a fair amount of needs that young people can face easily. This service thus helps elders to go through \u201csmall daily challenges\u201d and allows students to get some pocket change at the end. It also provides both of them some company and allow people from different age groups to build a precious bond.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Intergenerational co-housing: a remedy against elders\u2019 exclusion and students\u2019 struggle to find an affordable place to live<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rather than occasional activities, certain young people prefer sharing their daily lives with an elder person. It is the case of Salom\u00e9, a young woman studying arts in Paris. She used to read books to an elder person she knew, so when she had to move in Paris, she naturally chose to live with a 94 years old woman whose relatives were looking for a roommate on <a href=\"https:\/\/gensdeconfiance.fr\/\">Gens de confiance<\/a>. <strong>Intergenerational co-housing is helping her reduce the costs that come with Parisian life, but it is also a beautiful human experience<\/strong>. At the beginning, Salom\u00e9 occasionally visited her \u201cParisian grandma\u201d but today, she is almost always with her because they build a strong friendship. \u201cIf she did not go to the hairdresser, I can help with her coloration, but I can also make her diner or read her a story just for pleasure\u201d, she says. She insists that they both benefit from living together; Salom\u00e9 helps her \u201cParisian grandma\u201d with her daily tasks, but she also says she found her \u201cfoster family in Paris\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Various associations propose to young people and elders to live together, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/ensemble2generations.fr\/\"><strong>Ensemble2g\u00e9n\u00e9rations<\/strong><\/a><strong>, an association aiming to build and maintain a mutual aid between students and seniors by intergenerational co-housing contracts<\/strong>. Based in Paris, in \u00cele-de-France and in 26 other French cities, Ensemble2g\u00e9n\u00e9rations wants to resolve two problems: the lack and the expensive character of housing for students and the exclusion of elder people. Catherine, project officer at Ensemble2g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, says <strong>the benefits of intergenerational co-housing are mutual<\/strong>. Three formulas are proposed to students for them to adapt their schedule. Among them, a free formula where the student lives at the elder\u2019s home and must be with them 6 nights on 7 and 2 week-ends per month. But \u201cstudents are not professional home help! They must feel like they are at grandma\u2019s\u201d, says Catherine. The 5\u00a0000 duos formed since 2006 are not build as a relation between helpers and beneficiaries but on a solidarity-based model which is far more personal and warm. These contracts last 2 years in average and are appreciated by both students and elders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Decided to engage yourself?
