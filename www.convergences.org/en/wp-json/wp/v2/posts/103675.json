In December, the world leaders adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change, the first universal climate agreement aiming at keeping global warming below the threshold of 2 degrees. 2015 has been a year of essential commitments towards \u201cZero Exclusion, Zero Carbon, Zero Poverty&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201c3Zero\u201d objective shall pave the way for all actor and stakeholders towards a world free from exclusion, carbon and poverty. We believe that the \u201c3Zeros\u201d are inherently interlinked, and that they can only be achieved through actions which combine them, in a comprehensive and integrated way.<\/p>\n<p>The convergence of all actors and agendas is necessary to achieve those targets. Convergences therefore encourages co-construction between all actors from the public, private and solidarity-based sectors in order to foster partnerships aiming high and working to ensure a world free from exclusion, carbon and poverty.<\/p>\n<p>Committing to #3Zero, Convergences team wishes you a challenging and inspiring New Year 2016, full of promises and encounters.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2015 has been a great year for co-construction.
