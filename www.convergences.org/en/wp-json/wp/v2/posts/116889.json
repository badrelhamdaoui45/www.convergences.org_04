While in Africa, there has been a great increase in access and schooling in recent years, more refined measures have shown that a large proportion of pupils leaving primary schools did not have basic skills and that 50% do not reach secondary school. The educational offer must be adapted to the context. It is about taking formal and non-formal education into account and of being part of a local context, building on local capacity building &#8211; education is not limited to the school setting or public school recognized by the State and the support must really target capacity building for the teachers.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221; author=&#8221;Rohen d&#8217;Aiglepierre&#8221; company_name=&#8221;Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD)&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;off&#8221; portrait_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Rohen-daiglepierre.jpg&#8221; quote_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; use_background_color=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#f5f5f5&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>We tend to want to duplicate other education systems that do not meet the demands of households.

Learning to read is one of the most difficult things because it is not a planned act like eating or walking. Learning to read involves many skills that can be difficult to acquire. This is why support for children in their learning is often necessary. They need both pedagogical support from teachers, family support from parents but also support from the whole community, especially in some African countries where it plays an important role in everyday life. To be able to read is also an act of freedom for every individual: to read is to be able to enter the thought and the imaginary of the other. It is a way to grow.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_accordion admin_label=&#8221;Accord\u00e9on&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;] [et_pb_accordion_item]<\/p>\n<p>World Vision has developed the &#8220;Unlock Literacy&#8221; model, a program for learning to read, rooted in basic research that accompanies teachers, parents and the child community. The Unlock Literacy project is being implemented in 52 countries for the primary school cycle, but also in communities. This model is based on research that demonstrates that learning to read is complex: it is a cognitive, social and cultural activity. The development of reading is multi-contextual: children develop reading skills at school but also at home and in the community in general. Because of this, raising parents&#8217; awareness on the importance of education and training to accompanying skills of their children is essential. In the Unlock Literacy project, three environments are considered essential for learning to read: the family, the school, and the community at large. Between 2012 and 2017, the program was able to improve the literacy rate by nearly 1.7 million children by training 83,000 teachers, opening 6,000 reading clubs and publishing 4 million books.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item] [\/et_pb_accordion][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Texte&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;light&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;off&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>The family sphere is essential for learning to read, but this dimension is rarely taken into account in major educational reflections. It is often considered that education is only school-based, but the role of parents is also essential, though all too often neglected.<\/p>\n<p>An American study of Hart and Risley, \u201c30 million words\u201d, measures the number of words heard by children every day. The researchers found that between a 4-year-old child raised in an affluent environment and a child of the same age raised in a more disadvantaged environment, there is a difference of 30 million words heard. In a well-off family, children hear 32 assertions per hour. In a more disadvantaged family, they hear 5 assertions and 11 bans per hour. It is therefore clear that the family environment is essential for the control of vocabulary.<\/p>\n<p>A PISA survey on parenting practices also showed that 2 practices are linked to very good results in language proficiency at age 15: reading stories in primary school, and showing involvement in the child&#8217;s schooling.<\/p>\n<p>In France, we often talk about socio-economic criteria to explain the level of study. Yet that is not everything. 63% of the children of teachers complete three years of higher education while this rate is 52% for the children of executives. There are many parenting practices that are critical to children&#8217;s success and are not part of the school setting. Yet these parenting skills are largely unknown, especially by the parents themselves. For example, talking and reading aloud to children from an early age is very important.<\/p>\n<p>In our public policies, pre-schooling issues are put forward, which is indeed important. But this is not enough: it is important to invest in early childhood education, particularly by reinforcing parenting skills, which are a real lever for equal opportunities (James Heckman, Nobel Prize for Economics). This dimension is often neglected in our public policies. There are a lot of devices, whether in Southern countries or in Europe \/ America, set up to strengthen parenting skills. In the French case, we can for example quote the parents kit proposed in the Academy of Cr\u00e9teil to make workshops with the parents and the teachers, in a collaborative logic. This system has had a very strong impact in the fight against absenteeism.<\/p>\n<p>Parent training is a key issue and it is a relatively inexpensive investment. Conversely, when families fail, this poses many problems for the public powers in the long run. This work with parents is a crucial issue that teachers are poorly trained.

Approximately $5 \/ child \/ year is spent in sub-Saharan Africa for education. This is financed mainly by the states themselves (17% of GDP on average) and by households (43% of their income). Only 2% of international humanitarian funding goes to education, which is the first service mentioned among the needs (source: PLAN international study). The role and investment of the private sector in education, especially in developing countries, is currently the subject of much debate, especially since this investment is correlated with the State&#8217;s disengagement from investing in education: the question of the role and the place of the State arises to guarantee the access of the most vulnerable to the education system.<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Towards_an_educational_responsibility_of_companies_which_territorial_partnerships\"><\/span><strong>Towards an educational responsibility of companies: which territorial partnerships?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>At the heart of the debate, the &#8220;educational CSR&#8221;: what is the role of companies in education and training, and how should this role be valued? Education today appears as the &#8220;forgotten cause&#8221; in CSR; yet, many surveys show that young people are primarily looking for companies to train them for tomorrow&#8217;s jobs and to integrate young people into companies. On the question of the role of the company, a consensus quickly emerged in the discussions at the Forum: we must open to young people, as soon as possible, the world of work, the world of business, and motivate them to be actors of their professional future. This discovery of the professional world is done through sponsorships, open days, not limited to the secondary school internship. The company therefore has a role to play with young people to compensate for the limitations of the education system, and to correct contemporary ambivalences: elitism, obsession with diplomas and paths to success. Internally, also, companies must work for the employability of its employees by promoting changes and continuous training for its employees, particularly in soft skills. The school, for its part, must enhance the value of professional courses. Companies can therefore contribute to education through several channels: as a supplier of goods and services, as an employer, and as a partner in the general interest (skills sponsorship, dissemination of knowledge).<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_testimonial admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignage&#8221;
