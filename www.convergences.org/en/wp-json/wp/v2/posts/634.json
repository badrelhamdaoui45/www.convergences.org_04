A systemic change in our consumption and production patterns is one of the major challenges of our century, for both developing and developed countries.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Convergences World Forum gathers citizens, consumers, companies, local authorities, media and solidarity-based actors in a collective thought process, to build an international partnership for a paradigm shift.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Pillar II: Sustainable development: new practices, new financing<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The diversification of actors involved in the construction of the common good has been prominent step forward over the last years. As the role of actors is evolving, so are their practices and ways of funding: one can quote a greater implication of the beneficiaries of development projects, the emergence of diversified governance and business models, and the diversification of funders of development. How must each of these players adapt to the evolving financial, political and legal landscape to continue to maximize their social impact?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Pillar III: New technologies for change<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The combination of new technologies and development has already proved to have been a positive impact: digital technologies including social web and crowdfunding, green technologies, frugal innovation&#8230; Far from being the exclusive property of Northern countries, new technologies are massively spreading in the South: there are now more cellular phones in Africa than in Europe or the United States. These technologies are changing profoundly the economic and social structure with the emergence of new ecosystems of values and practices. How can new technologies be powerful tools for a more inclusive economy?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.convergences.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Convergences_program_2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&gt;&gt; Download the general outline of the programme &lt;&lt;<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Convergences World Forum will be held on September 8, 9 and 10, 2014 in Paris.
