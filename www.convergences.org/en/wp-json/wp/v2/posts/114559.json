This was like any other cash transfer in a disaster-striken country, but for one invisible detail.

It raised 20 million dollars to build a marketplace for peer-to-peer payments, microfinancing of digital loans and crowdfunding through fiat-pegged digital tokens.

In theory, it means that there is less need for intermediaries, reducing the overall cost of financial transactions.
