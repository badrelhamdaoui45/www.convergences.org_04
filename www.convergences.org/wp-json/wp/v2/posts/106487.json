The project relies on community volunteers and remote aid workers to match satellite imagery with colloquial landmarks, street names, and location nicknames onto the open-source platform OpenStreetMap. Creators hope the result will help humanitarian organizations manage risk and anticipate future crises in post-conflict areas.<\/p>\n<p>\u00ab\u00a0In many of [M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res] interventions, government agencies and many humanitarian organizations had outdated coordinates or poor information, which makes responding difficult,\u201d* said Camila Mu\u00f1oz Jim\u00e9nez, program coordinator for GEONG, the global conference for humanitarian organizations working on issues related to cartography, the convening event for CartONG, a mapping organization geared toward humanitarians and one of the organizations behind Missing Maps.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to return virtually to places that went through a crisis or conflict to update roads, landmarks and other information,\u201d she said. \u201cOften a village has moved, or people have been displaced after a conflict, and when aid workers show up there, they find they don\u2019t have the right information.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Through \u201cmapathons,\u201d the organization CartONG\u00a0asks local volunteers to digitally draw on satellite imagery from OpenStreetMap. Updates or details supplementing satellite imagery are then confirmed by cartographers, with the aim of distributing the maps to humanitarian organizations and locals.<\/p>\n<p>Jim\u00e9nez said the mapathons take about two hours and double as social events. She admitted her surprise when she found how the mapathons tend to draw crowds for its \u201cgame-like\u201d collaborative process. Missing Maps has piloted mapathons in several Western cities and in Bangladesh, Jim\u00e9nez said, with support from other humanitarian organizations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun because people are like, \u2018Hold on I know that road, that\u2019s not actually a building, it\u2019s just a car that\u2019s been parked there for a really, really long time.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. <\/strong><strong><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https:\/\/co-city.fr\/en\/pages\/1-how-does-it-work\">Co-City<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Co-City bills itself as a combination of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding services that empower anyone with an idea about how to improve their city.<\/p>\n<p>When he came up with the idea for Co-City, Guillaume Desmoulins was interning at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, looking at how crowdfunding could connect local organizations to governments, he told Devex.<\/p>\n<p>Co-City combines crowdsourcing and crowdfunding into a single platform \u201cso people can use it to find solutions to social or environmental issues in their own neighbourhoods, regardless of what stage their idea is in,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Desmoulins pointed to the example of the growing homeless population in his Paris neighborhood. \u201cIf I want to do something to help the homeless, but I\u2019m not really sure what, I can use the platform to find others and hold a meeting so we can develop the idea,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, those hoping to implement a project or get funding can use the service to find donors or like-minded organizations.<\/p>\n<p>Less than a year old, Co-City aims to expand internationally in 2018, first to Spain and then likely to Morocco, Desmoulins said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur partner right now is the City of Paris, so we need to stay close to them and make sure the concept is sustainable at the community-level,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. <\/strong><strong><a class=\"c5\" href=\"http:\/\/www.toolz.fr\/references.php\">Smart Favela<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Smart Favela, a computer program developed by the tech company Toolz and the winner of last year\u2019s Convergences prize, models the results of urban development projects in slums in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \u2014 known as \u201cfavelas\u201d in Portuguese.<\/p>\n<p>Since winning the award, Smart Favela has moved beyond favelas, partnering with the cities of Bordeaux and Paris for urban development projects. It now hopes to attract development agencies, cities and companies worldwide to its services.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne project I\u2019m excited about: we\u2019re partnering with the International Rugby Federation on a rugby stadium, but we are using virtual reality to allow developers to visualise the project on-site,\u201d Cl\u00e9ment Bergey, project manager for Smart Favela, told Devex.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are really ready for anything, anywhere,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. <\/strong><strong><a class=\"c5\" href=\"http:\/\/static.cdn.oneheart.fr\/front\/la-charte-des-spots.pdf\">One Heart Spots<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This mobile app allows users eating, shopping and living in the Global North to create impact in the Global South. Going about their daily lives, users can pinpoint and rate shops, restaurants and businesses based on their concern for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. These could be cafes that source fair-price coffee from farmers or businesses that take care to ensure human rights in their supply chain, for example.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative platform, so users can rate the spots and tell us what they want to see more of,\u201d Melanie Appadoo, head of partnerships for One Heart Spots, told Devex.<\/p>\n<p>Founded two years ago by communications firm One Heart Communications, the app is fully operational in France, with a growing presence in Brussels, Belgium, and New York City.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt takes some time, because we make a point to meet or speak on the phone with all the [potential] spots,\u201d Appadoo said. \u201cOur users want to know the spots\u2019 philosophies, who\u2019s behind it and get to know the business model.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The basic app is free to businesses and users, but those hoping to promote their business can pay for top listing.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>*Update, Sept. 13, 2016: <\/strong><\/em><em>This article has been updated to clarify Missing Maps&rsquo; operational and legal relationship with NGOs using its services.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you want to see on the <\/strong><\/em><em><strong><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https:\/\/pages.devex.com\/new-urban-agenda.html\">#NewUrbanAgenda<\/a><\/strong><\/em><em><strong>?
