What synergies can you see between Microfinance and Impact Investing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Microfinance investments can now be considered to fall within Impact Investing. This includes a much more diversified range of investments in the production of goods and services that have direct or indirect effects on the well-being and living conditions of people (i.e. energy, water, housing, healthcare, etc.). The sources of financing within microfinance are themselves diversified, and microfinance itself demonstrated social responsibility before Impact Investing did. The fact that microcredit leaders or specialists have turned to Impact Investing in recent years goes to show how close the two are. They contributed their experience towards its development.

This compatibility corresponds to a recognition of social and solidarity economy as having transformed how social economy has traditionally been understood. It is the action taken which must be considered, and not its legal status on its own. And so the area goes from so-called \u00ab\u00a0capitalist\u00a0\u00bb structures to those with \u00ab\u00a0social\u00a0\u00bb statuses and purposes.<\/p>\n<p>The development of Impact Investing can be likened to niche investment in a time of declining interest rates and 2008 post-crisis, which has forced diversification of investment risks and therefore the need to find new opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; 2. What is your assessment of microfinance and Impact investing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With respect to microcredit, we have become increasingly aware of its limitations in terms of its ability to achieve economic takeoff on its own. Following an unbridled growth, we have also seen an unexpected drop in the number of clients, especially poor clients. The focus has been placed on the financial inclusion of people through an expanded range of tailored services. The intentions displayed had been taken for actual effects, and many believed, in particular that, by nature, microfinance institutions always act for the greater good of their clients. Looking at the impact of an investment makes it easier to separate the wheat from the chaff.<\/p>\n<p>However, the limitations of Impact Investing are, as is the case of philanthropy, that those who have the means to engage in it make choices, whether via their investments or their gifts, which are certainly useful, but whose good intentions do not address the most essential or urgent needs. Certain sectors of activity or parts of the planet, which have a lower profile and are less profitable, can end up being neglected because of this free play whereby a strictly private logic escapes any democratically made choice. Crowdfunding presents the same danger given the much larger audience it addresses, with the risk of selecting only the most appealing projects instead of the most useful ones. As long as their contribution towards the bulk of development finance remains limited, there is no danger. However, this mismatch can be dangerous, especially in a context of restricting public budgets, which are able to offset these biases.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; 3.
